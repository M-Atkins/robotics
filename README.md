This is a python solution using ROS to make a turtlebot navigate a maze, it runs the mazerunner class, which uses seperate functions for calling movement, detecting colours, detecting angularity and collision detection. The program is able to: - Navigate the maze successfully - Avoid traps (red squares) - Detect and move towards Blue squares (clues) - Detect and move towards Green squares (finish)

How to start:

source ~/MATTHEW_ATKINS_CMP3103M 
cd ~/MATTHEW_ATKINS_CMP3103M
